OVERVIEW:

 Part 1 - 
 This project is to develop a simple ring buffer library that will allow fast
 debug logging for all of my system applications. 

INCLUDED FILES:

 * Makefile - build system of all set up
 * test-ring-buffer.c
 * ring.c
 * ring.h - struct list
 * README - this file

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 Clean up my directory
 $ make clean
 $ make
 
 Compile and running:
 $ ./grader

TESTING:

 Part 1 - 
 My professor gave lots of hints to make this project. He gave a 80 percentages of code.
 I could understand what the project is going from the code he given. 
 When I compiled and runned ./grader, I need to do 
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./lib in the command. 
 It was a simple programming and easy to finish before the compiling in the command. 
 
KNOW ISSUES:
 
 Part 1 -
 I got lots of information and knowledge about C library.
 The C library function FILE *fopen(cost char *filename, const char *mode) opens the filename
 pointed to, by filename using the given mode. There are mode and descriptios for fopen.
 I used "w" which creates an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name already exists, 
 its content is erased and the file is considered as a new empty file.
