		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Practice implementing and using a library </li>
			<li> Use struct's, pointers, and arrays </li>
			<li> Implement a systems level data structure </li>
			<li> Use Linux signals/handlers </li>
			<li> Use IO libraries from C </li>
		</ol>


		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		In this assignment, you will develop a simple ring buffer library that
		will allow fast debug logging for all of your system
		applications. This project is divided into two parts. In the first
		part you will implement the ring buffer using a simple array as the
		backing data structure. In the second part of the assignment you will
		make your ring buffer thread safe. This will give you two versions of
		the same library, one thread safe and one not. The wikipedia article
		on circular buffers is a good article to read through before you start
		coding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer">
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Our ring buffer will be a specialized version of the more general
		circular buffer. We will maintain only one index for writing log
		entries and reset the index to 0 when we are at the last entry. In other
		words if we have a standard array of length 6 (yielding indexes 0-5)
		when we reach the end of the array (index 5) we wrap back around to
		index 0 and write our data. We do not provide an option to remove an
		entry from the buffer.
		</p>
		<p>
		At first glance this may seem like a bad idea. Our ring buffer will overwrite
		previous entries, so how is this a good thing? The idea behind a ring buffer
		in systems level programming is speed. We want a fast data structure that the
		application can write log entries into for debugging purposes. A ring buffer
		is only a snapshot of the final few moments of an application's life. However,
		that snapshot is usually enough to give the developer an idea of where to
		start looking for a potential problem.
		</p>
		<h2>Implementation details</h2>
		<p>
		We are going to implement a very simple ring buffer. Our implementation
		is only going to maintain one index variable and an array of strings.
		When our program starts up we will allocate a fixed number of entries,
		initialize our buffer and start accepting calls.
		</p>
		<p>
		All the starter code is provided for you in the lab folder
		<code>C-examples/debug/ring-buffer</code>. The semantics
		of each method is detailed within the header file provided (ring.h). Our
		ring buffer will be compiled as a library so it can be used by other
		programs. Our first version will not be safe to use in an asynchronous
		manner (e.g. with multiple threads). We will make our code safe for multi-threaded 
		use in the next homework.
		</p>


		</h3>Signals</h3>
		<p>
		We will use the alarm system call on Linux to setup an interval for check-pointing
		our ring buffer to disk. This is valuable because there are times when
		our program may not be able to write to disk before a crash. So if we are
		always writing our log files at predictable intervals we can mitigate the
		risk that we crash and have absolutely no log files to look at. The
		worst case scenario is our log files are a little stale.
		</p>
		<p>
		Below are some lab files to look at to get you started with signals.
		You will want to setup an alarm signal in your code that will call the
		<code>dump_buffer</code> function.
		<ol>
			<li> <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/signals/wake-up.c">signals/wake-up.c</a></li> 
		</ol>

		<h2>Starter files</h2>
		<p>
		All of the starter files for this project are in the folder
		<code>C-examples/debug/ring-buffer</code> in the class resources
		repository. Everything should build out of the gate on onyx. We have provided
		a basic implementation that you will extend to checkpoint the buffer to disk at
		<code>alarm_interval</code> seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
		Make sure you execute a <code>git pull</code> command on the lab file directory
		before starting this project to get the most recent versions of the files.
		In your local working copy execute:
		</p>
<pre>git pull origin master</pre>
		<p>
		You must use the exact directory structure that is already setup in the
		lab as the grader depends on it to test your code. Copy these files in
		to your <code>p6</code> project folder in the backpack repository.
		</p>
		<h2>Hints</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> First read through all the code and to get an understanding of what is going on.</li>

			<li> Remember your job is to add check-pointing to this piece of code
			so you will have to add a few helper functions in ring.c. First, fix
			the <code>dump_buffer</code> function so that it prints the log messages
			from the <i>oldest</i> to the <i>newest</i>. Note that this isn't necessarily from
			index <i>0</i>&nbsp; to <i>MAX_LOG_ENTRY - 1</i> because we are using a circular
			buffer.  The constant <i>MAX_LOG_ENTRY</i> is defined in the <code>ring.h</code> header file.
			</li>

			<li>Then you will also have to fix the <code>dump_buffer</code> function to write to a file
			instead of just calling printf.
			</li>

			<li> Run valgrind often! (we have added it as the default run configuration
			in run.sh)</li> 
			
			<li> Take a look at the notes for C File IO for using file calls in C.</li> 
			
			<li> Read through the Signals slides.  [Example: <a
			href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/signals/wake-up.c">signals/wake-up.c</a>]</li> 
			
			<li> When you checkpoint your buffer to disk you should create a text file
			so a user could open it up in a standard text editor. All entries should
			be dumped to the file in order from the <i>oldest</i> entry to the
			<i>newest</i>
			entry. They should, however, be labeled as log entry <i>0</i> to
			<i>MAX_LOG_ENTRY - 1</i>. You should overwrite any existing log files that exist.
			</li>

			<li> Your program should not load up any existing logs when starting
			up. Any existing log files will simply be overwritten. If a user wants
			to save the log entries they would have to do that manually.
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Testing</h2> Look through the minimal testing that is provided for you
		in test.c.  In your README add a section on testing in which you enumerate how
		you will go about testing your ring buffer to ensure that it is correct. Once
		you have a test plan in place you are required to improve test.c so our program
		is a little more robust.

		<h3>Testing Hints</h3> Below are some things you should think about when testing
		your ring buffer.  This list is not all inclusive it is just a place to jump
		start your ideas.  <ol>
			<li> What happens if you try and log a NULL string? </li> <li> What
			happens if you try and log a string that is too long? </li> <li> What
			happens if you are trying to log at the exact same time you are dumping
			your log to disk? (Note: You should plan for this now even though we
			will not fix this until project P7).  </li>
			<li> What happens if our index counter, which is an int, overflows? </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Turning in your assignment</h2>
			<p>
			Once you have finished your assignment you can turn it in
			with the instructions below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open up a terminal or console and navigate to the backpack folder for the class.
					<!--Once you have a terminal open the submit process is the same
					across all operating systems.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate to the subdirectory that contains the source files that you worked on 
					for the project/homework. Suppose that we are submitting <strong> README.md</strong>,
					<strong>main.c</strong> and <strong>utility.c</strong>.
				</li>
        <li> Clean up your directory
<pre>make clean</pre>
        Remove any other unnecessary files that were generated by you or the auto-grader.

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 3 days</td>
			<td>70%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 4 days</td>
			<td>60%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>4+</td>
			<td>0%</td>
		  </tr>
