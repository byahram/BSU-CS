		<h2>Doubly Linked List</h2>
		Before you start modifying the code, read through all the files and
		make sure that you understand how they work. <strong>Do not modify
		any header files that are given to you. The grader depends on the
		header files for testing.</strong>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    This is the largest project of the semester and you have several weeks
    to complete it. We will be covering material that you will need as you
    work on it, so you will need to manage your time so you don't end up
    trying to do everything at the end. You <em>may</em> pull it off,
    but you will probably miss things and you won't learn everything that
    you should.

		<h4>Starter files</h4>
    <p>
    All of the starter files for this project are in the class lab repository in
    the directory <strong>C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked</strong>, including
    </p>
		<ol>
		  <li> Skeleton code for a doubly linked list.</li>
			<li> Test code with a simple test, a random test and unit test with stubs. </li>
		</ol>
    <p>
    Make sure you execute a <samp>git pull</samp> command on the lab file directory
		before starting this project to get the most recent versions of the files.
    In your local working copy, execute
<pre>
git pull origin master
</pre>
		You must use the exact directory structure that is already setup in the
    lab as the grader depends on it to test your code. Copy all the files from
    the doubly-linked folder into the <code>p3</code> project folder in your
    backpack class folder. Then add them to the backpack repository with the
    <code>git add</code> command. Assuming you are in the <code>p3</code>
    project folder in backpack, you will use commands similar to the following
    (adjusting the path as needed)
<pre>
cp -a ~/CS253-resources/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/* .
git add *
git commit -m "Setting up initial files for p3"
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Before working on your code, make sure that everything works as expected. To check,
    run <samp>backpack.sh</samp>. It should execute and produce output similar to the
    following. It should not pass because the list is not fully implemented, but if it
    runs, then things are set up correctly.
<pre>

NOTE: Data is possibly corrupt and could be wrong
</pre>
    <p>
    When you get the output above, delete the backpack output file and run
<pre>
make clean
</pre>
    Then, commit the starter files to your own p3 repository. Committing
    <em>before</em> you make any changes will allow you to revert back to
    a fresh state if you need to. It also helps you to see any changes you
    have made compared to your last commit.
    </p>

    <h4>Source Files and Documentation</h4>
    <p>
    Start looking through the source files provided in the <samp>libsrc</samp>
    and <samp>testsuite</samp> directories. Some of the syntax may not make
    sense yet, but we will be covering the topics in lecture soon (or, you can
    read ahead in the book/slides). You may also want to read through the
    <a href="http://cs.boisestate.edu/~cs253/p3/docs/files.html">javadoc style
    documentation</a> of the List, Node, and Object source files.
    <p>
    To generate the documentation on your own system, run
<pre>
make dox
</pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Linked-List Implementation Checkpoints</h2>
    <p>
      Once you understand how the List and Node are related, you can start working
      on completing the List functions. The <code>createList</code>,
	  <code>addAtFront</code>, and <code>printList</code>
      functions are done for you. Use these as a reference when you start working
      on the other functions. Here is a list of functions that must be done for
      each checkpoint. If Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2 are not completed on time your
      grade will drop by 20% (10% for checkpoint 1 and 10% for checkpoint 2).
    </p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint1">Functions due for Checkpoint 1</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>getSize</li>
      <li>isEmpty</li>
      <li>addAtRear</li>
      <li>reverseList</li>
    </ol>

	You should have finished the above functions and written unit tests for each
	function. You should have run valgrind and not be getting any memory errors
	or memory leaks (except for reachable memory).

    <h3 id="checkpoint2">Functions due for Checkpoint 2</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>removeFront</li>
      <li>removeRear</li>
      <li>removeNode</li>
      <li>freeList - requires knowledge of function pointers</li>
    </ol>
	You should have finished the above functions and written unit tests for each
	function. You should have run valgrind and not be getting any memory errors
	or memory leaks.


    <h3>Final Program</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>search - requires knowledge of function pointers</li>
      <li>any remaining functions not yet implemented</li>
    </ol>
	You should have finished the above functions and written unit tests for each
	function. You should have run valgrind and not be getting any memory errors
	or memory leaks.  At this point you should also be passing the grader.


    <p>
    As always, make sure you are testing often! See the testing sections
    below for more information on testing.
    </p>

		<h2>Testing</h2>
		<strong>In the "General Code Quality" portion of your grade
		you will lose points if you fail to implement any tests. Don't
		just rely on the grader file to find bugs. You are required to
		write your own tests to help you pass the grader.</strong>
		<p>
		Start with the SimpleTestList.c program that creates a list,
		reverses it and then frees the list. See if you can get this
		program working. SimpleTestList is just a smoke test for your
		code. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)">
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)</a>
		for a good definition of a smoke test.
		</p>
		<h3>Unit testing</h3>
		<p>
		In the file UnitTestList.c you will find an example of some
		unit tests. This test file is incomplete as it does not test all
		possible boundary conditions. Your job is to expand it to ensure that
		your list operates as expected.  One strategy for coming up with unit
		tests is to create tests as you are implementing your list and debugging
		with gdb and valgrind. Once you have identified the problem, write a
		unit test that exposes that problem (the unit test should fail at this
		point) and then fix your code which will cause your unit test to pass!
		</p>
		<p>
		Make sure to add even more tests to test boundary conditions. For
		example: what happens when the list is empty, when the list pointer is
		NULL, when you add the first node (at front or at rear), when you
		remove the last node, when you search for a node that does not exist
		etc.  Each unit test should only test one function at a time
		independent of the rest of the functions. You may have to build some
		scaffolding to be able to execute each method independently. There is
		a custom assert macro defined in UnitTestList.c that will print out a
		failure message when a test fails.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition to the custom assert defined in UnitTestList.c there is
		also an assert in the C standard library that you could leverage if
		needed.  The difference between the C standard library assert and our
		custom assert is the C library version will exit you program on an
		assertion failure while our assert will just print a message and
		continue executing the rest of your tests. You can read about the C
		library assert here:
		<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/">
		http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/</a>
		</p>

		<h3>Random Testing</h3>
		We have provided a completed test program RandomTestList.c,
		which does random testing of the various list operations. This
		simulates how an application may use the list and is used to check the
		stability of the list on a large number of operations. The random test
		program could also be used to assess the performance of your list
		implementation.


<pre>Usage: RandomTestList &lt;list size&gt; [&lt;test size=list size&gt;] [&lt;seed&gt;]</pre>


		The RandomTestList.c program shown above takes up to three
		arguments.  The first argument is required. The second argument is the
		number of random operations to perform. It is optional. The default
		value if not supplied by the user is the same as the initial size of
		the list. The third argument is the random generator seed. By setting
		a seed, you will get the same random number sequence, which can be
		helpful with debugging. Otherwise the random number generator sets a
		different seed for each run of the program.

		<h2>Memory Checking with Valgrind</h2>
		Run all your test programs (Unit, Random, etc) through the tool
		Valgrind to test for memory errors and leaks. Getting a clean
		bill of health from Valgrind can be tough! Failing to pass
		Valgrind will cause you to fail the auto-graded portion of
		this assignment.

    To run Valgrind, use the following commands from the top level of your
    p3 directory:

<pre>valgrind --leak-check=yes testsuite/SimpleTestList <arguments> </pre>

<pre>valgrind --leak-check=yes testsuite/RandomTestList <arguments> </pre>

<pre>valgrind --leak-check=yes testsuite/UnitTestList </pre>

		<h2>Turning in your assignment</h2>
			<p>
			Once you have finished your assignment you can turn it in
			with the instructions below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open up a terminal or console and navigate to the backpack folder for the class.
					<!--Once you have a terminal open the submit process is the same
					across all operating systems.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate to the subdirectory that contains the source files that you worked on 
					for the project/homework. Suppose that we are submitting <strong> README.md</strong>,
					<strong>main.c</strong> and <strong>utility.c</strong>.
				</li>
        <li> Clean up your directory
<pre>make clean</pre>
        Remove any other unnecessary files that were generated by you or the auto-grader.
        </li>
				<li> Add all your changes to Git
<pre>git add main.c utility.c README.md</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Commit your changes to Git
<pre>git commit -a -m "Finished project XXX"</pre>

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
