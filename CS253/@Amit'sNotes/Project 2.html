    <!-- <h1>DUE: Week 28 <small>(Jul 17, 2016 at 11:59:59 PM)</small> </h1> -->
    <h1>DUE: 7/15/16 by midnight  </h1> 

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use strings in C</li>
      <li>Dynamically allocate memory</li>
      <li>Use functions for string manipulation in string.h</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>

      We will write a small command line application that
      takes in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file on standard in,
      replaces any empty fields with XXXXXX and then outputs the
      normalized CSV file on standard out. Before you proceed please read
      the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files </a>
      to familiarize yourself with the data format.
    </p>
    <h4>Features that you must support</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Quoted fields (ex "Foo")</li>
      <li>Embedded quotes (ex "Foo is ""baz"""). Each embedded quote should be a pair </li>
      <li>Embedded , (ex "F,oo") within a quoted string </li>
      <li>
	You do <strong>not</strong> have to support line wrapping.
	You can assume that each line is a complete row in your CSV file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Optional features (your instructor may choose to give extra credit for correct implementations)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Detecting a row that does not have the required number of fields </li>
      <li> Detecting malformed quoted strings </li>
      <li> Detecting malformed double quoted strings </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Format of the data file</h3>
    <p>
      The data file that you will import can be any size.  Thus you
      will need to process one row at a time to avoid running out of
      memory (we will make the assumption that we have enough memory
      to read one entire row at a time). We want our program to be
      able to process any sized file. Below is an example of an input
      file and the resulting output that your program will produce.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Example of an input file 
    </h4>
    <pre>
"F,oo",Foo2,,baz
"loops ""are great""",,,groups
,for,each,while
,,,
    </pre>

    <h4>
      What your program should output 
    </h4>
    <pre>
"F,oo",Foo2,XXXXXX,baz
"loops ""are great""",XXXXXX,XXXXXX,groups
XXXXXX,for,each,while
XXXXXX,XXXXXX,XXXXXX,XXXXXX
    </pre>



    <h3> Implementation </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Your program should read from stdin and write to stdout. You
	are NOT supposed to use file operations (fopen, fclose,
	etc.). To send a text file to your program via stdin, use the
	shell input redirect operator <var>&lt;</var> as shown below:
	<pre>./homework &lt; data.csv</pre>
	will send the contents of <var>data.csv</var> to your program. Redirecting from standard-in
	is something that you have to do from the command line. It is not possible to do this
	from an IDE.
      </li>

      <li>
	Use <code>getline()</code> for reading the input from stdin. You can assume that you will
	always have enough memory to read in one single line. <code>getline()</code> has a great man page detailing
	its usage, which is also available <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getline.3.html">here</a>
      </li>
      <li>
	Fields that contain embedded commas or double-quote characters will be quoted.
	This means you can not use the <code>strtok</code> call to split out your line. You must walk through
	the line character by character and keep track of quoted fields.
      </li>

      <li>
	Your program should compile with no warnings when compiled with the <var>-Wall</var>
	option.
      </li>
      <li>
	Your program should not have any memory leaks or read write errors as reported by valgrind
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hints on parsing in a CSV file</h3>
    <p>
	When reading in the CSV file you may find it useful to create and follow a state machine diagram.
	      Review the example to remove blank runs with a single blank in the Git repository at:
		        <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/tree/master/C-examples/intro/remove-blanks">C-examples/intro/remove-blanks</a>. The example contains a state machine diagram as well as its implementation in C.
      We can apply this idea
      when parsing our CSV file by defining 5 states (START, QUOTED, DOUBLE_QUOTED, END_QUOTE,END).
      When we start parsing out a field we start in the START state and make transitions to other
      states when we see certain characters. If you would like to really dig deeper what we are
      actual building is a simple 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine</a> which you
      can read about on Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each edge node in the graph below represents a state and each edge
      represents a transition on a specific character. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Quote "</li>
      <li>Any character except " or ,</li>
      <li>Comma ,</li>
      <li>Double Quote ""</li>
      <li>Quote "</li>
      <li>Any character except Quote " or Double Quote ""</li>
      <li>Double Quote ""</li>
      <li>Any character except Double Quote ""</li>
      <li>Comma ,</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>The graph below is interactive! So you can play around with it!</strong>
    <style type="text/css">
     #transitions {
       margin:auto;
       width: 80%;
       height: 500px;

       {id: 2, label: 'QUOTED'},
       {id: 3, label: 'DOUBLE QUOTED'},
       {id: 4, label: 'END QUOTE'},
       {id: 5, label: 'END'},
     ]);

     // create an array with edges
     var edges = new vis.DataSet([
       {from: 1, to: 2, label:'1', arrows:'to'},

     ]);

     // create a network
     var container = document.getElementById('transitions');
     var data = {
       nodes: nodes,
       edges: edges
     };
     // these are all options in full.
     var options = {

		<h2>Turning in your assignment</h2>
			<p>
			Once you have finished your assignment you can turn it in
			with the instructions below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open up a terminal or console and navigate to the backpack folder for the class.
					<!--Once you have a terminal open the submit process is the same
					across all operating systems.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate to the subdirectory that contains the source files that you worked on 
					for the project/homework. Suppose that we are submitting <strong> README.md</strong>,
					<strong>main.c</strong> and <strong>utility.c</strong>.
				</li>
        <li> Clean up your directory
<pre>make clean</pre>
        Remove any other unnecessary files that were generated by you or the auto-grader.
        </li>
				<li> Add all your changes to Git
<pre>git add main.c utility.c README.md</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Commit your changes to Git
<pre>git commit -a -m "Finished project XXX"</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Push your files to the Backpack server
<pre>git push origin master</pre>
        </li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 3 days</td>
			<td>70%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 4 days</td>
			<td>60%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>4+</td>
