    <h1>DUE: 8/5/2016 (scaled to 50 points)</h1>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Linking a shared library to existing code. </li>
      <li> Updating an existing Makefile. </li>
      <li> Writing a shell script to test given code (using following elements): </li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>for loop 
	  <li>conditional statements 
	  <li>inline command execution, such as <code>value=$(cmd)</code>
	  <li>commands such as <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>echo</code>,
	  <code>basename</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>diff</code> etc. </li>
	  </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This assignment has two parts. First, we will build  
      a new application named <code>wf</code>, that computes frequency of
      words in a given text file. This application will be built using the
	  provided source code and uses our generic linked
      list library. Then, we will create a shell script that will run the
      resulting application for various input files and collect results. While
      doing this assignment, you should only be updating a Makefile and then
      writing a shell script. There is no C code to write. You should not be
	  modifying the <code>wf</code> application code.
    </p>

   <h2>Project Details</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<b>Setup</b>. First, do a <code> git pull origin master </code> in the CS253-resources
	folder to make sure you have the latest starter files. Also do a <code>git pull
	--rebase</code> in your backpack folder to make sure you have the latest backpack files for
	p5. Then grab the starter files from the class lab (CS253-resources/libraries/link-target)
	and place them in your p5 folder in your backpack repository. You will then need to
	update the provided Makefile so it points to the relative directory that your linked
	list program resides in (HINT: it is probably ../p3). You must use a relative directory
	or your program will fail to run on any other system. Make sure you understand	what
	a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Absolute_and_relative_paths">
	  relative path</a> is before attempting this step.  There is a TODO
	  in the Makefile to point
	you to the line of code to update.  After you have updated the
	Makefile you should be able to type <code>make</code> to build
	the wf executable.  Run <code>make clean</code> to make sure that
	everything that needs to be cleaned up is properly cleaned up.
	</li>

    <li> <b>Warmup</b>. Export your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable to include the <code>./lib</code>
	folder. Then run the <code>wf</code> executable. It should give you an usage
	message. 
<pre>
wf {--self-organized-list|--std-list} &lt;textfile&gt;
</pre>
    Now try running the program on a sample input file with both options. You
	will ntoice that even though both options come up with the same answer, the
	output list of words isn't arranged the same.
	<pre>
	wf --std-list input/sample-input.txt
	wf --self-organized-list input/sample-input.txt </pre>
	We can fix that by piping into <code>sort</code>. Try the following.
	<pre>
	wf --std-list input/sample-input.txt | sort
	wf --self-organized-list input/sample-input.txt | sort </pre>
	Now we can redirect the output into files and compare them to check that
	they are the same. First let's make a separate folder for the output files.
	If one already exists from before, we will remove it.
	<pre>
	/bin/rm -fr output
	mkdir output </pre>
	<pre>
	wf --std-list input/sample-input.txt | sort &gt; output/sample-input.txt-std-list-results
	wf --self-organized-list input/sample-input.txt | sort &gt; output/sample-input.txt-self-organized-list-results
	diff output/sample-input.txt-std-list-results  output/sample-input.txt-self-organized-list-results </pre>
	In a script, we would use an <code>if</code> statement and test the value of
	<code>$?</code> shell variable to see the return status from
	<code>diff</code> to see if the the two files were same.  In the next step,
	we will build a script that automates this whole process and repeats it for
	each input file.
	</li>


    <li><b>Create and test the script</b>. Create a test script named
    <code>tester.sh</code> that does the following.
	<ul>
	<li>Builds the <code>wf</code> program by calling <code>make</code>.</li>

	<li>Checks if the <code>output</code> folder exists. If so, it removes
	it and creates a new <code>output</code> folder.</li>

	<li>Then using a loop, the
	script runs <code>wf</code> twice on each file (for <code>--std-list</code>
	and <code>--self-organized-list</code> options)  in the
	<code>input</code> folder and  redirects the output (after filtering
	via <code>sort</code>) to a file in the <code>output</code> folder that
	is named the same as the input file followed by the option used. </li>

	<li> We want to process the files in order from the smallest in size to the
	largest in size. You can use the command <code>ls -Sr</code> in the for loop
	to iterate through the list of files from the smallest to the largest in
	size. You will probably also need to use <code>basename</code> to massage
	the name of the file properly.</li>

	<li>For each input file, it also uses <code>diff</code> to check if the
	output from the two options is the same and prints an appropriate
	message.
	</li>

	<li>
	<strong>Your tester.sh script should ensure that wf and the output
	folder are in the same directory as</strong> <strong>the backpack.sh
	script. The backpack script also expects you to follow a certain
	naming convention for the output files. </strong>
    See the following for the file name conventions. Note that the
	<code>-tr</code> option to ls lists files by time from oldest
	to newest.

<pre>
[amit@localhost solution(master)]$ ls -Sr input
sample-input.txt    Decl-of-Ind-USA.txt  Alice-in-Wonderland.txt        Tom-Sawyer-Abroad.txt  Leaves-of-Grass.txt
Bill-of-Rights.txt  US-Constitution.txt  Through-the-Looking-Glass.txt  Flatland.txt

[amit@localhost solution(master)]$ ls -tr output
sample-input.txt-std-list-results                Alice-in-Wonderland.txt-self-organized-list-results
sample-input.txt-self-organized-list-results     Through-the-Looking-Glass.txt-std-list-results
Bill-of-Rights.txt-std-list-results              Through-the-Looking-Glass.txt-self-organized-list-results
Bill-of-Rights.txt-self-organized-list-results   Tom-Sawyer-Abroad.txt-std-list-results
Decl-of-Ind-USA.txt-std-list-results             Tom-Sawyer-Abroad.txt-self-organized-list-results
Decl-of-Ind-USA.txt-self-organized-list-results  Flatland.txt-std-list-results
US-Constitution.txt-std-list-results             Flatland.txt-self-organized-list-results

Alice-in-Wonderland.txt-std-list-results         Leaves-of-Grass.txt-self-organized-list-results
</pre>
	</li>

      <li>
	<strong>Do not call make clean from your tester.sh script, remove the wf program, or remove the
	output folder in your script. The backpack.sh script will clean
	up all those files.</strong>
      </li>
	</ul>

      </li>

	  <li><b>Test it!</b> Run the provided <code>backpack.sh</code> script to
	  test it. Rinse and repeat if necessary.
      </li>

	  <li> <b>Sample output</b>. The following shows sample output from a <code>tester.sh</code>
	  script that matches/exceeds the specification. Your output doesn't have to look
	  the same.  In particular, this script shows the time it took for each run
	  and that is beyond the specs! If you are curious about how to time and
	  print it in inline, ask on Piazza :-)

	The README.md for this project should focus on the script and be fairly
	brief. It does not need
	to describe the <code>wf</code> other than that you are using a provided
	program. We are more interested in the discussion of your process in
	developing the script and the lessons you learnt along the way.

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 3 days</td>
