		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Convert a library for use in an asynchronous environment</li>
			<li> Use the Pthreads 
			(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">POSIX Threads</a>) library </li>
			<li> Use a simple Mutex to make the ring buffer library thread-safe </li>
			<li> Update a Makefile to link against the <code>pthread</code> library </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		  This project will build upon your ring buffer part 1 project (p6). In this project
		  you will add in the ability for your ring buffer to be used in an asynchronous
		  manner. This will require you to do three things. First, you will need to update
		  your ring-buffer to use a Mutex to protect reads and writes. Second, you
		  will need to update the test code to fire off multiple threads all of which
		  will try to log multiple messages each. Finally, you will need to run some tests on
		  your code and report the results in your README.md file.
		</p>

		<h2>Plan</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Copy all the files from your p6 folder to the <code>p7</code> folder and
			commit it. 
			</li>

			<li> Start by increasing the size of your ring buffer (<i>MAX_LOG_ENTRY</i>) 
			from 5 to 100. Test with your original test code <code>test-ring-buffer.c</code> to
			check that things still work as expected.
			</li>

			<li> Then make your ring buffer safe. Take a look at the
			  safe-bank-balance.c example for some guidance
			  (<a
			  href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/threads/safe-bank-balance.c">threads/safe-bank-balance.c</a>
			  and <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/tree/master/threads/account">threads/account</a>).

			  You will need to update your Makefile so your code will link against
			  the <code>pthread</code> library. If you forget to do this step you will see some
			  linking errors when trying to build your program.
			</li>

			<li> Once you have made your ring buffer thread-safe, create a new test file named
			<code>test-threads.c</code> to fire off <code>numThreads</code>
			threads that attempt to log <code>numLogs</code> messages each. 
			These
			values will be provided via the command line. Modify the log message
			to include a thread id and the log message number. You can generate
			sequential thread ids (<i>0</i> to <i>numThreads - 1</i>) using the technique shown in the example
			<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/threads/thread-ids.c">threads/thread-ids.c</a>
<pre>
$ grader
Usage: grader &lt;numThreads&gt; &lt;numLogs&gt; 
</pre>			  
			</li>

			<li>
			Modify the
			<code>Makefile</code> in the <code>test</code> folder to compile the
			<code>test-threads.c</code> file instead of
			the <code>test-ring-buffer.c</code>. 
			</li>

			<li> All threads will log to the <i>same ring buffer and hence the
			  same log file</i>. Due to the non-deterministic nature of threads it is
			  possible that you will get different results every time you run your
			  program. That is OK and is expected. Testing multi-threaded code is
			  extremely difficult without introducing artificial and arbitrary
			  code to force deterministic results.  Try testing with four
			  threads and 1,000,000 log messages (long enough for the alarm to go off
			  several times and log file to be written).
			</li>

			<li> Don't forget to protect the code in your signal handler as
			well! This could be directly or indirectly depending upon where you
			lock the Mutex.</li>

			<li> Finally run some tests where you modify the number of threads
			and the number of log messages (while keeping the total number of log
			messages constant) to see if you can spot a speed up, slow down or
			no difference at all when compared to the single threaded version. For example, you can
			run the grader as shown below.
<pre>
grader 1 1000000
grader 2 500000 
grader 3 333333
grader 4 250000
</pre>

			Report the times and your analysis in the README.md file.

			</li>

			<li> Make sure to look for corrupt messages when you are testing your
			  code as it may indicate a problem with where you have (or have not) placed
			  your Mutex locks.
		    </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Grading Rubric </h2>
		<p>
		  This is the last assignment of the semester. Thus, you will be responsible for 100%
		  of the testing, the backpack.sh script does not do any testing. The rubric below details the 
		  grading breakdown for this assignment.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li> Fixed all problems from p6 (10 points) </li>
			<li> Proper use of command line arguments in test-threads.c (10 pts)</li>
			<li> Proper use of pthread library in the file test-threads.c (30 pts) </li>
			<li> Proper use of a Mutex in ring.c (all relevant functions protected) (30 pts) </li>
			<li> Code quality (10 pts) </li>
			<li> README.md (10 pts)</li>
			<ul> 
			<li> Use the usual template and fill in all sections. Make sure to
			discuss how you tested it </li>
			<li> Report the times you get by running different number of threads</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
