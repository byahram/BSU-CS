    <!-- <h1>DUE: Week 27 <small>(Jul 10, 2016 at 11:59:59 PM)</small> </h1> -->
    <h1>DUE: 7/6/2016 (by midnight)</h1> 

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Checkout the lab examples from the public git repository.</li>
      <li> Familiarize yourself with C.</li>
      <li> Use command-line development tools.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      This class will be using the C programming language and the Linux operating
      system. All the code examples and your programs must compile and run on the
      onyx cluster. Thus, we will take the time to setup our account and get everything
      working so we can complete the required assignments. All the necessary tools are
      already installed on the cluster. During this course we will be using Vim, Git, GCC,
      Valgrind, and Make (to name a few).
    </p>

    <h2>Lab Repository Checkout (Git)</h2>
    <p>
      You will need to checkout a local copy of all the examples and project starter files
      you will need throughout the semester.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Create a directory somewhere on your development system for your lab files.</li>
      <li> Navigate into the directory you created and check out the CS253 lab repository using the following command.</li>
      <pre>git clone https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources</pre>
    </ol>

    <h2>Backpack Repository Checkout (Git)</h2>
    <p>
      You will be using Git to submit your assignments this semester. You should have received
      an e-mail from your instructor with a setup file for backpack. Instructions for
      setting up backpack on the onyx cluster are located at
      <a href="http://cs.boisestate.edu/~cs253/#backpack">http://cs.boisestate.edu/~cs253/#backpack</a>. 
      Once you have setup your backpack repository you can start working on your assignment.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting up Git</h2>
    <p>
      In the top-level of your backpack checkout, add a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file. Look at the
      <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/.gitignore"
	 title="sample .gitignore file">.gitignore</a> in the CS253-resources directory and use it as an example.
    </p>
    <h2>Word Counting in C</h2>
    <p>
      Write a C program that reads text from standard input stdin and counts the number
      of words, lines, characters and each digit (0-9) found in the input. Your program will
      print the results to standard output stdout.
      <p>
	<h3> Getting started </h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Navigate to the project folder in your backpack
	    directory you will find your stater files that you can edit.
	  </li>
	  <li> You can open a file in Vim with the command <kbd>vim <filename></kbd>
            (Read the <a href="http://cs.boisestate.edu/~cs253/handouts/vim-handout.pdf">notes on vim</a>
              if you need some help getting started with Vim.)
	  </li>
	  <li> You can build your project with the command <kbd>make</kbd></li>
	  <li> You can clean all your files with the command <kbd>make clean</kbd></li>
	</ol>

	<h3> Implementation </h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Your program should read from stdin and write to stdout. You are
	    NOT supposed to use file operations (fopen, fclose, etc.). To send a text file to
	    your program via stdin, use the shell input redirect operator, <var>&lt;</var>.
	    For example:
	    <pre>./homework &lt; data</pre>
	    will send the contents of <var>data</var> to your
	    program. Redirecting from standard-in is more convenient from the command line than from an IDE. 
	  </li>

	  <li> Use <code>getchar()</code> for reading the input. Each line read from stdin
	    will be terminated with a newline character. When getchar returns EOF,
	    the end of the file has been reached.</li>

	  <li> You may use the examples in Chapter 1 of The C Programming Language book and in
	    your '<samp>CS253-resources/C-examples/intro</samp>' directory as a starting point.</li>

	  <li> The output will be a table containing the number of words, lines, characters,
	    and each digit (0-9) in the given input. Run the provided grader to see an example
	    of the output.
	    <pre>./grader &lt; data</pre>
	  </li>

	  <li> The output is expected to be sent to stdout (the console).  You can use the output
	    redirect operator, <var>&gt;</var>, to save (redirect) the output of a program to a
	    text file. Therefore, running something like
	    <pre>./homework &lt; data &gt; results</pre>
	    will store the results of your program in a file called <samp>results</samp> instead
	    of printing it on the screen.</li>

	  <li> Your program should compile with no warnings when compiled with the <var>-Wall</var>
	    option.</li>

	</ol>

		<h2>Turning in your assignment</h2>
			<p>
			Once you have finished your assignment you can turn it in
			with the instructions below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open up a terminal or console and navigate to the backpack folder for the class.
					<!--Once you have a terminal open the submit process is the same
					across all operating systems.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate to the subdirectory that contains the source files that you worked on 
					for the project/homework. Suppose that we are submitting <strong> README.md</strong>,
					<strong>main.c</strong> and <strong>utility.c</strong>.
				</li>
        <li> Clean up your directory
<pre>make clean</pre>
        Remove any other unnecessary files that were generated by you or the auto-grader.
        </li>
				<li> Add all your changes to Git
<pre>git add main.c utility.c README.md</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Commit your changes to Git
<pre>git commit -a -m "Finished project XXX"</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Push your files to the Backpack server
<pre>git push origin master</pre>
        </li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 3 days</td>
			<td>70%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 4 days</td>
			<td>60%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>4+</td>
			<td>0%</td>
		  </tr>
