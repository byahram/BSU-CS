		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Familiarize yourself with make </li>
			<li> Write a fairly simple Makefile </li>
			<li> Write multiple make targets </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		In this assignment, you will gain experience with Makefiles. Your task 
		for this assignment is to write a Makefile that will compile the
			provided files <code>main.c</code>, <code>f1.c</code>,
			<code>f2.c</code>, <code>f3.c</code>, and the common header file
			<code>myHeader.h</code> into a single executable. 
		The Makefile should produce an executable named <code>hello</code> once you are all done.
		The Makefile should use macros such as <tt>CC, CFLAGS, \$@, \$^</tt> etc.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Your Makefile will be named <code>Makefile</code> and you can test it by
		running the command below. 
		</p>	

<pre> make </pre>

		<p>
		You will also need to add a target to the Makefile named <i>run</i> that will build 
		and then execute your program. Your run target should have a dependency on the 
		build target that you defined earlier. 
		</p>

<pre>make run</pre>

		<p>
		Then you will need to define a clean target that will removed any generated files
		that were created during the build process.
		</p>

<pre>make clean</pre>

		
	<p>
		Finally, you will need to modify the Makefile so that the executable is
		rebuilt if the header file changes. You must do that using the
		<code>-MMD</code> flag for <code>gcc</code> compiler and the
		<code>-include</code> feature in Make for the auto-generated header dependency files. You can
		test this quickly using the <code>touch</code> command as shown below:
	</p>

<pre>
touch myHeader.h
make 
</pre>

	<p> It should rebuild the project because touch updates the timestamp on the
	file (if the file already exists).

		<h2>Turning in your assignment</h2>
			<p>
			Once you have finished your assignment you can turn it in
			with the instructions below.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Open up a terminal or console and navigate to the backpack folder for the class.
					<!--Once you have a terminal open the submit process is the same
					across all operating systems.-->
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate to the subdirectory that contains the source files that you worked on 
					for the project/homework. Suppose that we are submitting <strong> README.md</strong>,
					<strong>main.c</strong> and <strong>utility.c</strong>.
				</li>
        <li> Clean up your directory
<pre>make clean</pre>
        Remove any other unnecessary files that were generated by you or the auto-grader.
        </li>
				<li> Add all your changes to Git
<pre>git add main.c utility.c README.md</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Commit your changes to Git
<pre>git commit -a -m "Finished project XXX"</pre>
        </li>
				<li> Push your files to the Backpack server
<pre>git push origin master</pre>
        </li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Grading breakdown</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>50 pts - Passing all the grader scripts</strong>. 
				This portion of your project is
				pass fail.  Once you have successfully passed all the tests
				lined out in the ./backpack.sh script you will automatically
				get 50% of the total grade. <strong>If you intentionally write
				code that subverts the grading script (E.g. hard coding the
				answer to elicit a pass, exploiting a bug in the grader, etc)
				your grade for the entire project will be set to 0. </strong>
				Everything that you need to pass the grader is enumerated in
				the project specification. If you think you have found a bug
				in the grader then please report it to your instructor.
			</li>

			<li>
				<strong>40 pts - General code quality</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is formatted in a consistent manner (Hint #1: Use a code 
                        formater such as astyle. See the script 
						<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/format.sh">format.sh</a>  from CS253-resources repo) 
                        (Hint #2: Use Vim to format your code automatically)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Code is well documented. Each *public* function must be 
						documented in the .h (header) file. You will use javadoc style comments (using the Doxygen 
						program) to document your functions. Most of the code that you will use this semester has 
						this already done for you. For an example look 
                        at <a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-resources/blob/master/C-examples/linked-lists/doubly-linked/libsrc/List.h">List.h in the class repository</a>.  Documentation for *.c files is not required unless you 
						expose functions publicly in the .c file in which case it must be documented. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Modularity. Code is broken into appropriate files 
						and functions. If you are copying and pasting code then you should be putting that code 
						into a function and then calling the function.  Copy/pasting code is a well known source of bugs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <font color="green">15 pts</font> - Code is semantically and logically correct. 
						C/C++ are unsafe languages which can allow dangerous bugs to "lurk" for years until they pop up. 
						Even if your code passes the 
                        grader you can still have errors. For example statically allocating a global array can 
                        allow off by one errors that even the venerable Valgrind can not detect. Thus, when grading
                        your code any errors that are found will still be docked regardless if your code "runs perfect" 
                    </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>10 pts - README.md file</strong>. Fill out the template located at
				<a href="https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md">README.md</a>.
				Our README's will be using the Markdown format. You can get more information at
				<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown cheat-sheet</a>
                <ul>
                   <li> <font color="green">5 pts</font> - Used the template that was linked off of the project 
				   	    specification page 
				   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Each section is <strong>relatively</strong> free of 
				        grammar and spelling errors. At a bare minimum you should run spell checker on your document. 
						Vim has the ability to spell check.
                   </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">2 pts</font> - Everything in the README.md is correct. </li>
                   <li> <font color="green">1pt</font> - The "Sources Used" section is properly filled out. </li>
                </ul>
                    
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Late policy</h4>
		<a name="late_policy"></a>
		<p>
			For each day after the stated due date you will lose 10% off the total
			score. Late scores are all calculated programmatically so a submission
			that is 1 second late (on our server)  will still be marked as late by
			the grading scripts.  <strong>No extensions will be given beyond what
			is listed in the table below.</strong>

		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			<th>Days Late</th>
			<th>Maximum possible score</th>
			</tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>100%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 1 day</td>
			<td>90%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 2 days</td>
			<td>80%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 3 days</td>
			<td>70%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>less than 4 days</td>
			<td>60%</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>4+</td>
			<td>0%</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
