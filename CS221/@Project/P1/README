OVERVIEW:

 This program is making two-dimensional arrays by using TestNG framework 
 to check correctness of a Java class.


INCLUDED FILES:

 List the files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.

 * GridMonitor.java - source file
 * GridMonitorTester.java - source file
 * README - this file

 In GridMonitor.java, there is constructor for compiling.
 GridMonitorTester.java is needed for TestNG.

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac GridMonitor.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java GridMonitor
 $ java org.testng.TestNG gridMonitor.xml
 

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
 
 I made all things in constructor in GridMonitor and returns in their class each other.
 

TESTING:

 That was the first time to use TestNG.
 It was confused to me to catch up what the problems are. 
 I could handle how it works and how I can catch up problems from this project.


DISCUSSION:

 At first, I had problem about the text file "widerange.txt". 
 I couldn't catch up that professor said to download this file and try it as new.
 That was why the problem about that wasn't working at all. 
 Also, I had some problems about the basicGrid when two-dimensional arrays are not in square.
 Not only them, there are small errors like negative value, and logical in basicGrid.
 I asked those to tutor in the lab. So I got it now everything!
 I didn't like to use TestNG because I couldn't catch up the problems.
 However, I felt great when the errors were decreasing.
