OVERVIEW:

 I make the program which simulates the running of a collection of clocks
 over various periods of time by using polymorphism.


INCLUDED FILES:

 List the files required for the project with a brief
 explanation of why each is included.

 * ClockSimulation.java - include main method to print sample output
 * Clock.java - abstract class
 * TimePiece.java - Interface class
 * AtomicClock.java - sub class of the Clock class
 * CuckooClock.java - sub class of the Clock class
 * GrandfatherClock.java - sub class of the Clock class
 * Sundial.java - sub class of the Clock class
 * WristWatch.java - sub class of the Clock class
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:
 
 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac ClockSimulation.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java ClockSimulation


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

  The main concepts and organization of my program is the implement class inheritance.
  This program is needed to use polymorphism to store classes from the same inheritance
  tree in the same container and use of generic programming to dynamically assign stored
  objects.
  
  The Clock class is abstract class, which implements the TimePiece interface.
  The Sundial, CuckooClock, GrandfatherClock, WristWatch, and AtomicClock classes are 
  sub classes of the Clock class which is abstract class.
  The ClockSimulation class is included the main method to print the output values.

TESTING:

  I couln't get the same value of the sample output exactly. 
  I was figured out what I have problem. It was in reset method.
  I didn't reset the clocks to their start times so they have different output.


DISCUSSION:
 
 I had a problem to get the value of the same sample output exactly. That is because 
 I didn't reset the clocks to their start times. So, I did reset the clocks every for 
 loop in ClockSimulation class. After then, I got the correct output.
