## Introduction

Here at Boise State University the Computer Science Department is 
growing in number and it is happening fast. Currently the faculty to 
student ratio is 27:1, and as years go by student size will continue
to grow. That is why project is important for the future of the CS 
department.


## Summary

The focus of this project is to create a self-tour mobile application
for the students and faculty exposed to the CS Department building.
Upon completing thie project, Boise state faculty will have a self 
touring application for students visiting the building for the first 
time. Students will be able to take a tour at whatever time is more
convenient, and find out more about the Computer Department and the 
building. 


## Setup Project
1. windows
    First, in the command prompt as administrator, run the file
    named 1_windows_choco.bat to download chocolatey
    Secondly, run the file named 2_windows_ionic.bat to download
    Node.js, and then install all of the project's dependencies.
    At this time, it should not run as administrator.
2. Mac
    Run mac_linux file. The Node.js package is downloaded and 
    installed using curl so no additional package manager is needed.


## Project Objectives

- Ensure that every student is able to receive a tour of the CS 
building as well as finding information about the CS department.
- Alleviate the load on faculty member by reducing personal tours.


## Methods

- Gather faculty information (e.g. name, email)
- Pictures of class rooms
- Computer Science department information
- Ecosystem URL
- Maps of the 2nd and 3rd floor.


## Framework

Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrind mobile app developments.
Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps
using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass.


## Target Users

- First year BSU students
- Hight School students(seniors)
- Current students
- Parents/ Visitors


## Conclusion

Creating this application, will benefit the CS Department by making 
tours an easier process for everyone. Since we are moving to a more 
technological world, instead of sticking with person to person tours
we should also move tours into a mobile application in the near future.


## Future Development

- Database workd perfectly in 'contact us' page
- Interactive map guide
- Implement 360 photos of all places
- Implement user friendly interface
