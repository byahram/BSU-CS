	REMEMBER
	For conditional with &&, BOTH sides must be true
	For conditional with ||, ONLY one side must be true

	The evaluation occurs in the following steps:
	1)  Do what's in parenthesis first:
		!found || z > 0, which evaluates to TRUE because left side is true
	2)  AND the above with found (Left to Right precendence)
	    found && TRUE, which evaluates to FALSE because left side is false
	3)  AND the above with z+x==5
		FALSE && z+x == 5, which evalues to FALSE because left side is false
	4)  OR the above with x+y>6
		x+y>6 || FALSE, which evaluates to TRUE because the left side is true
