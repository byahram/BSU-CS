#Sample Questions from Amit
* Explain the difference between a class and an object (for Java or C#)
* Explain the difference between an interface and a class (for Java or C#)
* What is the difference between a static variable and an instance variable?
* What is method overloading?
* What is method overriding?
* Explain polymorphism with a simple example




* Write a method that takes an array of integers as a parameter and returns the maximum.


* Write a method that takes a String s as an argument and returns a new String that contains all the characters in even positions from the input String. For example, for
```java
   String s = “Whoa”
```
would return “Wo”

* Write a method that returns a String of given length n that has random characters from a - z (lowercase)
```java
public String randomString (int  n) { … }
```

* Suppose we have a class called Box that has width, height, depth  as its attributes. The
values are doubles. In addition it has a boolean attribute named full that represents whether
it is empty or full.
    * Write a loop that creates 10 boxes with random width, height, depth (within the range 1 - 10) that are all empty. Keep track of the box with the largest volume and print out the details of the box at the end.

    * Modify the above code snippet so that it creates an array of box objects so that we can keep track of the boxes.
    * Some relevant methods that are available and defined appropriately in the class are shown below.

```java
    public Box(double width, double height, double depth)
    public void getFull()
    pubic void setFull(boolean full)
    public double volume()
    public String toString()
```

  * Discuss how to implement a doubly-linked list? That is, show declarations and selected method headers. Do the same for a binary tree.

  * **Check Permutation**: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. What is the runtime of your solution?

  * Design an algorithm that finds the index of the first 1 from a sorted array of 0’s and 1s. What is the time complexity of your solution in big-Oh notation?

  * Given an unsorted set with n keys. Determine if there are two key values that sum up to exactly x. What is the complexity of your algorithm?
  * Given a sorted set with n keys. Can you design a faster algorithm for the above problem?

* Ask if they know graph representations. 
  * Hash tables instead of adjacency lists for graph representation: pros and cons?
  * Sparse versus dense graphs
