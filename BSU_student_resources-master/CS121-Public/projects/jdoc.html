<h1>Program Documentation Tool: javadoc</h1>

<p>One of the tools that comes with the standard Java installation is a
program called <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a> which will
generate documentation similar to that for the 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">Java API</a> 
documentation.  

<p>Basically, you use a special kind of comment, which looks almost like the
usual multi-line comments, to put the information you want to appear in the
documentation into your program text.  The documentation utility uses these
comments along with the class and method signatures to generate the
documentation.  

<h3>Javadoc Comments</h3>

<p>A javadoc comment is preceded by the characters <tt>/**</tt>
and terminated by a <tt>*/</tt>.  All the text inside is considered to be part
of the documentation. You can format javadoc comments by using standard HTML 
tags. 

<p>Javadoc comments should be placed immediately before the part of the program
that they describe.  Typically, you will have such a comment immediately befor
each class or interface header, method signature or member variable
declaration.  By default the utility only shows information for public
components.

<h3><a name="tags" />Documentation Tags</h3>

<p>There are some special tags you can use within your javadoc comments to
indicate specific types of information.  A partial list appears below; see the
official documentation for others.

<table width="80%" border=1>
<tr><td><b>Tag</b></td><td><b>Location</b></td><td><b>Effect</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>@author</td><td>class comment</td><td>Lists author(s) of code in
documentation if -author option is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@version</td><td>class comment</td><td>Requires the -version option 
to be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>@param</td><td>method comment</td><td>Used to explain method
parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>@return</td><td>method comment</td><td>Used to explain the return
value of a method</td></tr>
<tr><td>@throws</td><td>method comment</td><td>Used to list exceptions thrown
by the method.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Generating the Documentation</h3>

<p>On onyx, you generate documentation for a group of Java classes by typing the
command
<br>
<blockquote>javadoc -author -version -d html/ *.java
</blockquote>
<br>
This will put the html files into a directory called html which you should
create first.  There will be a file called index.html which lists all the
classes and one file for each class.
</p>
<p>In Eclipse, you can use the <tt>Generate Javadoc</tt> option from the 
<tt>Project</tt> menu.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
/**
 * The Widget class represents a widget in a standard Thingamajig.
 *
 * @author Sam Stoodent
 * @version 1.0 CS121 Fall 2025
 */
public class Widget {

  /**
   * Carries out the central function of a Widget
   *
   * @param rotations number of widget rotations, positive values are clockwise turns,
   *   negative values are counterclockwise turns
   * @param pushes number of widget pushes, must be a positive integer
   * @return widget output
   * @throws InvalidInputsException
   */
  public double doWidgetStuff(double rotations, int pushes) throws InvalidInputsException {
    // regular single-line comment
    ...statements...

    /*
     * regular block comment
     */
    ...more statements...
  }
}
</pre>

<h3>Utilities for other languages</h3>

<p>A utility called 
<a href="http://www.cppdoc.com/">CppDoc</a> documents
C++ programs using basically the same
syntax as javadoc for specifying what goes into the documentation.
