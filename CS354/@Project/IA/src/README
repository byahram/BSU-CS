Interpreter Assignments #1: Expressions and Assignments

Author: Ahram Kim
Class: CS354-001

Overview:

  This project makes me extend a small interpreter. 
  
Compiling and Using:

  I compile the java
    $ javac *.java
  And, execute the java. For example, 
    $ java Interpreter "x=1+2;" "y=x+2"
   
Testing: 

  I got all correct values for int.
  However, I had some problems about supporting double.
  I add the period "." in the String s but I still have the error.
  And, I was trying to change the 'nextNumber()' method instead of
  changing 'initDigit()' method. I was trying to do 'indexof()', and
  'parseDouble' but was not working correctly.
