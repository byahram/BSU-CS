PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 This assignment asked me to begin using an object-oriented imperative programming 
 language named SmallTalk, which is more object oriented than Java.
 It had mutiple versions of syntax, all of which are rather neanderthal.
 It had constructors, which are just static methods. 
 Method name could be the same as an instance variable, but the formal parameter
 cannot be the same as an instance variable.

TESTING:

 I tested 'gst Customer.st' for the first and kept my working until the statement 
 'gst Customer.st Account.st CheckingAccount.st SavingAccount.st Bank.st' passed.


DISCUSSION:
 
 It looked easy when I am assgined this assignment. However, there were lots of 
 small mistakes. It was hard to catch those mistakes.
