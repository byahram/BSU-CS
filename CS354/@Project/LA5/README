 I used zetcode.com/gui/csharpwinforms/firststeps/

 In this part of the Mono Winforms tutorial, there are some basic progrograms
 in Winforms programming library. I started to make a simple.cs and try it 
 works or not. I used the using directive, which allows me to use a type from
 an appropricate namespace without a fully qualified name.
 In Winforms, any window or a dialog is a Form. This control is a basic
 container, whose purpose is to display other child controls. 
 Text and Size are properties of a form. To compile the file,
 used 'mcs -r:System.Windows.Forms.dll -r:System.Drawing.dll simple.cs'.
