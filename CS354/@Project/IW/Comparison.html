  <ol>
    <li>Java is a more stand alone language. Unlike JS(base Js) that must primarily be ran placed 
      inside an HTML document to function, Java is a much more larger and complicated language that creates "standalon applications"</li>
    </li>
    <li>
       Java must be compiled into what is known as a "machine language" before it can be run on the Web
    </li>
    <li>Once the Java is compiled, it is set. Sure, you can go back to the original text and alter it, but then you need to compile again.</li>

  </ol>
  <br></br>
<h1 class = "JS">JavaScript</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>As you can see by the examples JavaScript is ussually percieved as more readable and easy 
      to understand language</li>
    <li>JavaScript can be used for many different things, but many of it's commands(Event Handlers) can be embedded right into existing HTML commands.
      which it makes it perfect for use along with HTML and CSS.</p>
     <li> A little more forgiving then java. Allows more freedom with the creation of variables and objects</p> 
     <li> JavaScript is text-based. You write it to an HTML document and it is run through a browser. You can alter it after it runs and run it again and again</li>
