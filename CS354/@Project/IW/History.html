<h1>History</h1>
<div class = "fir">
  <ol>
    <li>javaScript was released with the initial need for a "glue language", that was easy for Web-designers and 
    part-time programmers to assemble components like images and plugins.
    </li>
    <li>It was initially named LiveScript, but later renamed to JavaScript when officially deployed in the 2.0 beta.
    </li>
    <li>In December 1995, very soon after the realse of JavaScript for browsers, an implementation was offered for server-side scriptingss
    </li>
    <li>Since then many different server-side JS implementations have been introduced. NOde.js being one of the most popular in 2009
    </li>
    <li>As with most scripting languages, JavaScript is dynamically typed; a type is associated with each value, rather than just with each expression.
    </li>
    <li>JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object-oriented languages use classes for inheritance.
