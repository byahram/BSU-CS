                        <h3> My life started in a humble village in the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea. My parents lived happily
                        together and did all they can to provide for me and my siblings all that we needed to achieve our goals in life.
                        When I was growing up, life was not a bed of roses, we had to devise ways to use the little resources we had at 
                        home to get education and be comfortable. My greatest motivation came from parents who believed that with 
                        right education, I can achieve greater things in life. Although they were not privileged to access education due 
                        to prevailing poverty, they had high hopes in me and my siblings that things will be differnet. 
                        <br> </h3>
                        <h3> When everything seemed to be on the right track, the unexpected happened in my family. My father who was 
                        the sole bread winner of the family strated to get difficulties in hit business. The sales started to shrink and
                        the perishable goods started to go bad. Eventually, he closed the shop because of massive losses he was experiencing.
                        Our lives came to a complete standstill. Now it was time for all of us to cut costs and look for ways to survive. For 
                        once, I thought that my education will end prematurely. My father and mother did not want us to stop our education
                        and did all they can help us stay in school. They wanted me to study and pass well and go to
                        study abroad regardless of the prevailing situation at home. They encouraged me to do my best
                        and not to be distracted by the problems at home. Each day, my father reminded me that our
                        present situation is not permanent, and that if we want to be better in life, we must focus on what
                        is ahead of us. My mother advised me that I should remain disciplined and do my best at school
                        and the good grades will come my way.<br> </h3>
                        <h3> To help my parents, I used to do part time jobs every day after school. I cleaned houses,
                        washed dishes and sometime tended the gardens in my neighborhood. All these jobs I did them 
                        well so that I can get more jobs over the weekend to help me pay some of the school fees and
                        also give my parents to buy food and for other basic needs. At first, my father was against the
                        idea of me working but when I insisted, he agreed to let me do the jobs. I remained disciplined
                        and worked very hard until I completed my A level. <br> </h3>
                        <h3> My career path was shaped by my visit to RiotGames in South Korea and in the United
                        States. The men and women working in at RiotGames were neat and worked very passionately.
                        They were courteous and ready to show me around the organization. One thing that got my
                        attention was their prowess in computer programming. The staff members that I interacted with
                        encouraged me that with good background and practice, I can become one of the best software
                        engineers in future. When everyone in my class chose to do either pharmacy or medicine, I took
                        the risk and followed my passion to venture into the world of programming. After the visit at the
                        RiotGames Company, my passion for computer software career became even bigger. I am
                        currently studying Computer Science in order for me to gain the necessary skills to enable me
                        become a great software engineer that I dreamed of becoming. Although my childhood and the
                        existing environment at home were not conducive, I have proven that with determination and
                        focus, one can achieve their goals. I am one of the best students in my class and I want to prove
                        that I have what it takes to be the best in software engineering field. <br> </h3>
