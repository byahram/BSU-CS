# Project 3 : Regular Expressions

* Author: Ahram Kim, Ella Lee
* Class: CS361
* Semester: Fall 2018

# Overview

This java program constructs an NFA for a given regular expressions.

# Compiling and Using
To compile, execute the following command in the main project
directory:
```
$ javac -cp ".:./CS361FA.jar" re/REDriver.java
```
Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java -cp ".:./CS361FA.jar" re.REDriver ./tests/p3tc1.txt

```
# Discussion
It was very helpful to be able to reference the recursive descent parsing documentation.
We started with drawing NFAs by hand to see how Regular expressions can be converted to NFA.
In the book, Example 1.58 (p 69) was helpful to see a few of the minor steps.
We were so glad to use DFA/NFA libraries!
