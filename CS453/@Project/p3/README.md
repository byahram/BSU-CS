## Building the project

There was a sample which shows the usage of the readline library in p1 write up. 
I implemented the sample in other-progs/test-readline.c to my main. 

## Testing

When I worked all and try, it was all messy. I couldn't check my every error and warning. so I make them from the small part. Someh

### Valgrind

I didnt finished so I didnt have time to check it. 

### Known Bugs

During this project, I had lots of experience to have 'segmentation fault(core dumped)' and Aborted(bumped). I didnt figure out the Aborted(bumped).

## Reflection and Self Assessment

During every project, I feel to start the project as earlier as I can. I should not have delayed to do the project to tomorrow. No more tomorrow. 

I think my hardest part for this project is to make it job. Some part of the commands 'jobs' worked before but It was messy and bumped. 


## Sources used

I used boiseState/CS253-resources and boiseState/CS453-resources.
