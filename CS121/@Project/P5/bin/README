# Project 5 : MyTunes GUI

* Author: Ahram KIm
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2016

## Overview

This Java application is to implement the basic iTunes like application with a heat map
visualization that show you which songs you play the most. 
It makes me to use JPanel, JLabel, and Jframe for the design.
I designed and implemented a graphical user interface(GUI) program and good user interface.


## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
$ javac MyTunesGUI.java
$ javac MyTunesGUIPanel.java


Run the compiled class with the command:
$ java MyTunesGUI
$ java MyTunesGUIPanel

## Discussion

I used several classes from the AWT and Swing graphics packages. 
I manages a grid of buttons using a 2-dimensional array.
I reused classes that I implemented previously in a new context.
I also applied the basics of event-driven programing using events and listener.
That is the hardest project I worked ever. I took lots of time and endeaver. 
I couldn't finish perfectly and submitted. However, I will try to finish perfectly even if
the due date would be passed.
