* Author: Luke Hindman
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2016

## Overview

This Java application displays an animated marshmallow with features based on
user input specifying sponginess, color, sugar density, and burn resistance.

## Compiling and Using

    To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
        $ javac PlayList.java
    To run the compiled class with the command:
        $ java PlayList


## Discussion

I got some problems and errors during the section 3(Calculate the average play time) and 4(Find the song with play time closest to 4 minutes). 'if' method didn't work well and when I changed the order of the three song, the song which is the closest to 4minutes also changed. I asked the tutor how to do and make it.
