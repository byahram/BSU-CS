## Discussion

I develop a class to represent a playlist of songs. Professor provided a driver class with a menu and some methods for rading Song data from files. I reused the class for this project.

I used lots of methods such as arraylist, tostring, setter, getter. It makes me confused to do this project. I couldn't recognize this method should be used what I need to use. And, the programming was so picky. The programming shoule be same so making the same programming makes me so tired.
